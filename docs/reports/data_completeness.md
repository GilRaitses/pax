# Data Completeness Report

## Summary

- **Total Zones**: 82
- **Zones with Sufficient Data (≥3 images)**: 0 (0.0%)
- **Zones with Partial Data (1-2 images)**: 81 (98.8%)
- **Zones with Missing Data (0 images)**: 1 (1.2%)
- **Total Images**: 157
- **Sufficient Threshold**: 3 images

## Zones by Data Completeness

### Zones with Sufficient Data (≥3 images)

These zones have enough images for baseline generation:

*No zones have sufficient data yet.*


### Zones with Partial Data (1-2 images)

These zones have some data but need more images:

| Zone | Images | Cameras |

### Zones with Missing Data (0 images)

These zones have no images collected yet:

| Zone | Cameras |
|------|----------|
| 9 | 1 |


## Recommendations

1. **Priority Zones**: Focus collection efforts on zones with missing or partial data
2. **Sufficient Data**: Zones with ≥3 images can be used for preliminary baseline generation
3. **Full Baseline**: Requires 2 weeks of continuous collection (672 images per camera)
4. **Collection Rate**: Monitor collection rate to estimate completion timeline

## Next Steps

- Continue data collection to reach ≥3 images per zone
- Extract features from available images
- Generate preliminary stress scores
- Update baseline as more data becomes available
