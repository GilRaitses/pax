  title: "Energetic Pathfinding and Perceptual Heuristics in Manhattan Navigation"

  introduction:
    subject_area: |
      Artificial Intelligence – Search and Reasoning Systems.
      The project focuses on heuristic search, knowledge representation,
      and perception-based reasoning, linking foundational AI theory
      to real-world sensory modeling.
    problem_statement: |
      Traditional pathfinding algorithms optimize for geometric distance
      or time but fail to capture the energetic and perceptual dynamics
      of real-world movement. In dense environments like Manhattan,
      cost is not defined by distance alone but by sensory and behavioral
      complexity—crowding, visual noise, and movement unpredictability.
      The problem addressed here is how to design an intelligent agent
      capable of integrating sensory context into its reasoning process
      for route selection. The project reimagines the A* search paradigm
      with a perceptually informed heuristic derived from camera data,
      modeling what it means for an agent to “feel” resistance in the
      environment it navigates.

  aim: |
    To implement and evaluate a heuristic search system that learns
    energetic pathfinding behavior by integrating sensory data
    into classical A* reasoning, demonstrating how perception-driven
    cost modeling can improve interpretability and environmental realism
    in AI navigation.

  objectives:
    - Define a Manhattan-based navigation environment between Grand Central Station and Carnegie Hall using a grid of intersections as states.
    - Construct a knowledge base from NYC traffic-camera data, translating visual detections into symbolic features representing environmental conditions (bikes, cars, pedestrians, obstructions).
    - Develop a perceptually weighted heuristic that adapts energetic cost functions based on visual context.
    - Implement A* search and compare it to standard Manhattan-distance-only heuristics.
    - Evaluate differences in efficiency, realism, and interpretability between baseline and perceptual systems.
    - Present visualizations showing how sensory context alters route choice and total cost.
    - Reflect on implications for embodied AI and human-centered navigation modeling.

  rationale: |
    This project applies heuristic search and reasoning methods learned in class
    to a realistic urban navigation task. It connects theoretical AI models
    to sensory data from a dynamic real-world environment, extending the notion
    of cost and optimality to include perceptual load and behavioral friction.
    It exemplifies how AI systems can transition from abstract reasoning
    to embodied decision-making.

  initial_work_plan:
    - Week 1–2: Review relevant algorithms from course material (uninformed search, informed search, constraint satisfaction).
    - Week 3: Preprocess NYC traffic-camera dataset and extract feature sets (density, obstructions, flow).
    - Week 4–5: Build knowledge base and assign weighted costs to edge transitions.
    - Week 6: Implement classical A* with Manhattan heuristic.
    - Week 7–8: Develop perceptual heuristic integrating vision-derived features.
    - Week 9: Compare performance metrics and generate visualizations.
    - Week 10: Draft final report and presentation materials.

  methodology_summary: |
    The agent’s reasoning follows the PEAS framework (Performance, Environment,
    Actuators, Sensors). The environment is a discretized Manhattan grid;
    performance is measured by minimal energetic cost; sensors derive context
    from traffic-camera imagery; actuators represent directional movements.
    The heuristic integrates classical pathfinding logic with environmental
    features to approximate human-like reasoning about effort.
    Constraint satisfaction logic filters infeasible or undesirable paths.
    The resulting system demonstrates how AI agents can merge perception
    with symbolic reasoning in practical navigation scenarios.

  expected_contributions: |
    The project demonstrates how informed search can evolve toward perceptually
    grounded reasoning. It contributes an applied framework that makes heuristic
    logic interpretable, showing the connection between environmental perception
    and decision-making. It also bridges course concepts—state-space search,
    heuristic admissibility, knowledge representation, and CSP integration—
    through a single coherent implementation.
