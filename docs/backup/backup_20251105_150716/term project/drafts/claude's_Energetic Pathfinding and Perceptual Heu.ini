Adaptive Heuristic Learning for
Stress-Optimized Pedestrian Navigation
Integrating Perception, Reasoning, and Real-World Sensory Context
1 Introduction
1.1 Subject Area
This project operates within Artificial Intelligence – Search and Reasoning Systems, focusing
specifically on heuristic search, knowledge representation, and perception-based reasoning. The
work links foundational AI theory—as covered in [1]—to real-world sensory modeling using computer
vision and urban data streams.
The project extends classical pathfinding algorithms (A*, weighted A*) by incorporating perceptually
informed heuristics derived from live camera data. This bridges the gap between abstract
state-space search and embodied decision-making in dynamic environments.
1.2 Problem Statement
Traditional pathfinding algorithms optimize for geometric distance or travel time but fail to capture
the energetic and perceptual dynamics of real-world movement. In dense urban environments
like Manhattan, the cost of traversing a route is not defined by distance alone but by
sensory and behavioral complexity—crowding, visual noise, infrastructure gaps, and movement
unpredictability.
The problem addressed here is:

CIS 667 Term Project Proposal Gil Raitses
How can we design an intelligent agent capable of integrating sensory context
into its reasoning process for route selection?
The project reimagines the A* search paradigm with a perceptually informed heuristic derived
from NYC traffic camera data, modeling what it means for an agent to “feel” resistance in the
environment it navigates. This is inspired by human pedestrians who naturally avoid stressful
routes based on visual and spatial cues—crowded intersections, poor lighting, aggressive traffic
patterns.
Key Research Question:
Can learned heuristics from vision-based environmental features outperform standard Manhattandistance
baselines in predicting route stress and improving path interpretability?
Aim of the Project
To implement and evaluate a heuristic search system that learns energetic pathfinding behavior
by integrating sensory data into classical A* reasoning, demonstrating how perceptiondriven
cost modeling can improve interpretability and environmental realism in AI navigation.

2 Objectives
This project will achieve the following specific objectives:
1. Define Navigation Environment: Construct a Manhattan-based navigation graph between
Grand Central Station and Carnegie Hall using a grid of intersections as states,
leveraging the existing NYC Vibe Check infrastructure (907 camera zones, Voronoi tessellation).
2. Build Knowledge Base: Construct a knowledge base from NYC traffic camera data,
translating visual detections into symbolic features representing environmental conditions
(bikes, cars, pedestrians, obstructions, violations).
3. Develop Perceptual Heuristic: Create a perceptually weighted heuristic that adapts
energetic cost functions based on a 17-dimensional feature vector extracted from camera
analysis (Google Cloud Vision API).
4. Implement Search Algorithms: Implement A* search with multiple heuristic variants:
• Standard Manhattan distance (baseline)
• Learned weighted heuristic (Ridge regression on features)
• Adaptive weighted A* (W ￿ [1.0, 1.5], inspired by Programming Problem 3)
5. Comparative Evaluation: Evaluate differences in efficiency, realism, and interpretability
between baseline and perceptual systems using:
• Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on predicted stress scores
• Path diversity metrics (Monte Carlo sampling)
• Feature importance analysis (top predictive factors)
6. Visualization: Present visualizations showing how sensory context alters route choice
and total cost, including:
• Route comparison maps (baseline vs. learned heuristic)
• Feature weight distributions
• Stress score predictions vs. ground truth
7. Reflection: Discuss implications for embodied AI and human-centered navigation modeling,
connecting to PEAS framework and constraint satisfaction principles from course
material.

4 Project Type
This is an Applied Project (Category D in proposal guidelines), which aims to gain experience
from learning and applying known methods to realistic situations. The project will:
• Apply heuristic search methods (A*, weighted A*) to a real-world urban navigation task
• Integrate machine learning (Ridge regression, feature engineering) with classical AI search
• Analyze and summarize experiences with synthetic data generation and model validation
• Identify refinements through comparative experiments
Rationale: This project connects theoretical AI models from course material—uninformed
search (BFS, DFS), informed search (A*, greedy best-first), constraint satisfaction, and knowledge
representation—to sensory data from a dynamic real-world environment. It extends the notion
of cost and optimality to include perceptual load and behavioral friction, exemplifying how AI
systems can transition from abstract reasoning to embodied decision-making.
5 Methodology
5.1 PEAS Framework
The agent’s reasoning follows the PEAS framework (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors):
• Performance Measure: Minimize energetic cost (stress score) along navigation path; beat
baseline MAPE of 14.6% from ARIMA predictions
• Environment: Discretized Manhattan grid (907 Voronoi zones from NYC Vibe Check); dynamic
traffic conditions; partially observable via camera sensors
• Actuators: Directional movements (N, S, E, W) along street intersections
• Sensors: Google Cloud Vision API analyzing traffic camera imagery; 17-dimensional feature
vectors encoding violations, density, infrastructure quality
5.2 State Space Representation
States: Intersection nodes (camera zone centroids)
Actions: Move to adjacent intersection (based on street connectivity)
Goal Test: Reach target zone (e.g., Carnegie Hall from Grand Central)
Path Cost: Weighted sum of learned heuristic values across traversed nodes

5.3 Heuristic Design
5.3.1 Baseline: Manhattan Distance
ℎmanhattan(𝑛) = |𝑥𝑛 − 𝑥goal| + |𝑦𝑛 − 𝑦goal|
Admissible but ignores environmental context.
5.3.2 Learned Perceptual Heuristic
ℎlearned(𝑛) = w𝑇 f(𝑛) + 𝑏
where:
• f(𝑛) = 17-dimensional feature vector for node 𝑛
• w = learned weights from Ridge regression
• 𝑏 = intercept term
Features include: pedestrian walkway violations, dangerous bike positioning, red light violations,
flow blocking, car-bike lane violations, pedestrian density, vulnerable populations, traffic volume,
visibility, infrastructure gaps, poor signage, signal malfunctions, cyclist speed, aggressive behavior,
infrastructure quality, weather impact, overall safety risk.
5.3.3 Adaptive Weighted A*
𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑔(𝑛) + 𝑊 ⋅ ℎlearned(𝑛)
with 𝑊 ∈ [1.0, 1.2, 1.5] to balance optimality vs. speed (inspired by Programming Problem 3
experience with 8-puzzle).
5.4 Data Pipeline
5.4.1 Existing Infrastructure (NYC Vibe Check)

Ground Truth: Temperature/stress scores (range: 5.0–24.0, mean: 14.5) serve as target variable
for supervised learning.
5.4.3 Synthetic Data Augmentation
Due to limited sample size (5 records), training data will be augmented using:
1. Bootstrap Resampling: Replicate existing samples with Gaussian noise injection [2]
2. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling): Interpolate between feature vectors in knearest
neighbors
3. Target: Generate 100–500 synthetic training samples while preserving 5 real records as
validation/test set
