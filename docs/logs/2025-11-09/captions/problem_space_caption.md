# Problem Space Figure Caption

## Suggested Caption:

**Figure X: Problem Space for Undirected Graph Search with Multi-Scale Coverage Zones**

This figure illustrates the problem space for an undirected graph search problem, where spatial coverage zones (defined by traffic camera locations) partition the search space to enable multi-scale resolution analysis. The coverage zones represent different levels of granularity needed to determine Pareto-optimal solutions, allowing the search algorithm to efficiently explore the solution frontier by considering both local neighborhood characteristics and global path structure. The red boundary defines the problem space between Grand Central Station (START) and Carnegie Hall (GOAL), with coverage zones providing the multi-scale resolution necessary for evaluating trade-offs in the Pareto front.

## Alternative Shorter Caption:

**Problem space for undirected graph search, showing spatial coverage zones that enable multi-scale resolution analysis for Pareto front determination.**

## Title Options (derived from caption):

1. **"Problem Space: Multi-Scale Coverage Zones"** (current - concise and descriptive)
2. **"Graph Search Problem Space: Multi-Scale Spatial Division"**
3. **"Manhattan Search Space: Coverage Zone Analysis"**
4. **"Problem Space: Multi-Resolution Coverage Mapping"**

## Key Terms:
- **Coverage zones** (instead of "Voronoi partitioning") - less technical, more intuitive
- **Multi-scale resolution** - emphasizes the different levels of granularity
- **Pareto front** - the key optimization concept
- **Undirected graph search** - the problem type
