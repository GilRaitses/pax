# Camera Corridor Visualization Caption

## Suggested Caption:

**Figure X: Camera Corridor with Extended Coverage Zones**

This figure shows the extended camera corridor (purple boundary: 34th-66th St, 3rd-9th/Amsterdam) containing 82 traffic cameras used for multi-scale resolution analysis. The problem space (red boundary: 40th-61st St, Lex-8th/CPW) is nested within this wider corridor, demonstrating the relationship between the constrained search space and the extended coverage area needed for Pareto front determination. Each camera defines a coverage zone through Voronoi tessellation, with numbered markers indicating cameras within the purple corridor. The START point (Grand Central) and GOAL point (Carnegie Hall) are marked, showing the search problem context within the broader camera network.
