Daily log for November 11, 2025.

## Status
- **Date**: 2025-11-11
- **Previous Log**: [2025-11-10.md](./2025-11-10.md)

## Today's Work

### Setup
- Created daily scripts folder: `scripts/2025-11-11/`
- Created daily log: `docs/logs/2025-11-11.md`

### Quarter-Based Download System
Created a batch download system that organizes downloads into 6-hour quarters:
- **Q1**: 00:00-05:59 (midnight-6am)
- **Q2**: 06:00-11:59 (6am-noon)
- **Q3**: 12:00-17:59 (noon-6pm)
- **Q4**: 18:00-23:59 (6pm-midnight)

**Scripts Created:**
- `scripts/2025-11-11/download_quarter.py` - Download a specific quarter
- `scripts/2025-11-11/download_batch_quarters.sh` - Batch download sequence

**Download Sequence:**
1. Yesterday's Q3 (noon-6pm) - ready to download now
2. Yesterday's Q4 (6pm-midnight) - ready to download now
3. Today's Q1 (midnight-6am) - ready to download now
4. Today's Q2 (6am-noon) - wait until after 12pm ET

**Updated:**
- `scripts/2025-11-10/download_todays_images.py` - Added `target_date` parameter to support downloading specific dates

### Batch Download Execution
Ran batch download script successfully:

**Results:**
- **Yesterday Q3 (noon-6pm)**: 901 images (already complete, no download needed)
- **Yesterday Q4 (6pm-midnight)**: 890 downloaded, 4 failed (timeouts)
- **Today Q1 (midnight-6am)**: 965 downloaded, 7 failed (timeouts)
- **Today Q2 (6am-noon)**: 969 downloaded, 11 failed (timeouts)

**Summary:**
- Total successfully downloaded: ~2,725 images
- Total failed (timeouts): 22 images
- Success rate: ~99.2%

**Notes:**
- Failed downloads were due to 30-second timeout limit on `gsutil cp` commands
- These can be retried later if needed
- Monitor window continues running until manually stopped (Ctrl+C)

### Next Steps: Baseline Generation
With ~3,969 images now available (vs. 157 previously), we should re-run baseline generation:

**Created:**
- `scripts/2025-11-11/run_baseline_generation.sh` - Automated baseline generation script

**Steps:**
1. Extract features from all ~3,969 images using BRANCH 1's vision models
2. Compute updated stress scores per camera zone
3. Generate updated baseline heatmap
4. Update data completeness reports

**Expected Improvements:**
- Much better data coverage (3,969 vs. 157 images)
- More accurate stress scores
- Better baseline quality
- More zones with sufficient data (≥3 images)

### Pending Tasks
- Run baseline generation with new data
- Retry failed downloads (22 images with timeouts) - optional
- Verify collection system is running correctly
- Continue collecting data for full 2-week baseline

## Notes
- Download script (`scripts/2025-11-10/download_todays_images.py`) was updated yesterday to:
  - Detect partial downloads by comparing file sizes
  - Re-download files that are smaller than expected
  - Filter by time range: 12pm-6pm ET (default)
  - Track re-downloads separately
- Collection system should be running every 30 minutes via Cloud Scheduler (OAuth authentication)

## Next Steps
1. Run download script to get yesterday's images (12pm-6pm ET)
2. Verify collection status for today
3. Continue with project work based on Master TODO
