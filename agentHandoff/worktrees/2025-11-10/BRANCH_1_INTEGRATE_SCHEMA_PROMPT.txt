Great progress! BRANCH 2 has completed the feature vector schema.

When you reach Task 1.4 (Create Feature Extraction Pipeline), integrate BRANCH 2's schema:

1. Import the schema:
   ```python
   from pax.schemas.feature_vector import FeatureVector, SpatialFeatures, VisualComplexityFeatures, TemporalFeatures
   from pax.schemas.validation import validate_feature_vector
   ```

2. Use the schema in your extractor:
   - Create FeatureVector objects from model outputs
   - Use validation functions to ensure quality
   - See examples in docs/examples/feature_vectors_examples.json

3. The schema is in: src/pax/schemas/feature_vector.py
4. Validation is in: src/pax/schemas/validation.py
5. Documentation: docs/schemas/empirical_structure_spec.md

This will ensure your extracted features match the standardized format needed for the search algorithm.
