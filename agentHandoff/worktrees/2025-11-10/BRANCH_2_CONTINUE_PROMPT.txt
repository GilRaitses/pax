Great! Tasks 2.1 and 2.2 are complete. Let's continue with the remaining BRANCH 2 tasks.

Task 2.3: Create Data Validation Code.
- Write validation functions for feature vectors
- Check feature ranges and types
- Handle missing values gracefully
- Create validation module: src/pax/schemas/validation.py
- Test validation on example feature vectors
- Output: Validation module with tests

Task 2.4: Document Empirical Structure.
- Write comprehensive specification document
- Include examples for each feature type
- Document integration with search algorithm
- Update or create: docs/schemas/empirical_structure_spec.md
- Include usage examples and best practices
- Output: Complete empirical structure specification

Task 2.5: Generate Example Feature Vectors.
- Create examples for each camera zone type
- Show edge cases (very busy, very quiet zones)
- Create example file: docs/examples/feature_vectors_examples.json
- Include examples for:
  - High stress zone (busy intersection, rush hour)
  - Low stress zone (quiet street, off-peak)
  - Medium stress zone (moderate traffic)
- Output: Example feature vectors JSON file

Once all BRANCH 2 tasks are complete, the empirical data structure will be fully defined and ready for BRANCH 1 to use!
