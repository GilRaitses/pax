I want to work on BRANCH 5: Infrastructure & Tooling.

See agentHandoff/worktrees/MULTI_AGENT_WORK_TREE.md for full details.

BRANCH 1 is now complete! The feature extraction pipeline is available:
- src/pax/vision/extractor.py (single image extraction)
- scripts/extract_all_features.py (batch processing)

Let's start with Task 5.1: Create Batch Image Processing Script.
- Enhance existing extract_all_features.py or create wrapper
- Process images in parallel (multiprocessing)
- Handle failures gracefully with retry logic
- Resume from checkpoint if interrupted
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/batch_process_images.py
- Output: Enhanced batch processing with parallelization

Then Task 5.2: Set up Feature Storage.
- Choose storage format (Parquet recommended for ML)
- Create schema based on BRANCH 2's FeatureVector
- Set up storage location: data/features/
- Create storage module: src/pax/storage/feature_storage.py
- Support both JSON and Parquet formats
- Output: Feature storage system

Then Task 5.3: Create Feature Query/Retrieval API.
- API to query features by camera, time, zone
- Support filtering and aggregation
- Create module: src/pax/storage/feature_query.py
- Include functions for:
  - Get features by camera ID
  - Get features by time range
  - Get features by zone
  - Aggregate statistics
- Output: Feature query API

Then Task 5.4: Build Feature Extraction Monitoring.
- Track extraction progress
- Monitor errors and failures
- Generate extraction reports
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/monitor_extraction.py
- Output: Monitoring dashboard/script

Finally Task 5.5: Create Data Quality Checks.
- Validate feature completeness
- Check for outliers
- Identify data quality issues
- Use BRANCH 2's validation functions
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/check_feature_quality.py
- Output: Data quality check script

This work builds on BRANCH 1's extraction pipeline and BRANCH 2's schema/validation.
