I want to work on BRANCH 3: Baseline Generation (Partial).

See agentHandoff/worktrees/MULTI_AGENT_WORK_TREE.md for full details.

BRANCH 1 is now complete! Features can be extracted from images using:
- src/pax/vision/extractor.py (single image)
- scripts/extract_all_features.py (batch processing)

Let's start with Task 3.1: Process Available Images per Camera Zone.
- Group images by camera zone (using camera manifest: data/manifests/corridor_cameras_numbered.json)
- Count images per zone
- Identify zones with sufficient data (≥3 images)
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/process_images_by_zone.py
- Output: Zone data availability report (docs/reports/zone_data_availability.md)

Then Task 3.2: Compute Preliminary Stress Scores.
- Extract features from images (or use already extracted features if available)
- Use simple heuristics to compute stress scores:
  - Pedestrian count (higher = more stress)
  - Vehicle count (higher = more stress)
  - Crowd density (higher = more stress)
  - Visual complexity (higher = more stress)
- Compute mean stress per zone (where data exists)
- Handle zones with insufficient data gracefully
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/compute_stress_scores.py
- Output: Preliminary stress scores JSON (data/stress_scores_preliminary.json)

Then Task 3.3: Identify Zones with Sufficient Data.
- List zones with ≥3 images (sufficient for baseline)
- List zones with 1-2 images (partial data)
- List zones with 0 images (missing data)
- Create report: docs/reports/data_completeness.md
- Output: Data completeness report

Then Task 3.4: Generate Partial Baseline Heatmap.
- Use BRANCH 4's heatmap script: scripts/2025-11-10/generate_baseline_heatmap.py
- Visualize stress scores for zones with data
- Mark zones with insufficient/missing data clearly
- Output: docs/figures/baseline_heatmap_partial.png

Finally Task 3.5: Document Data Gaps.
- Identify which zones need more images
- Estimate when full baseline can be generated (need 2 weeks = 672 images/camera)
- Create data collection priority list
- Create report: docs/reports/data_gaps.md
- Output: Data gaps document

This work uses the feature extraction pipeline from BRANCH 1 and the visualization scripts from BRANCH 4.
