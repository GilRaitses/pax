I want to work on BRANCH 4: Visualization & Analysis.

See agentHandoff/worktrees/MULTI_AGENT_WORK_TREE.md for full details.

Let's start with Task 4.1: Create Image Quality Assessment Script.
- Check image resolution, clarity
- Identify corrupted/missing images
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/assess_image_quality.py
- Generate quality report: docs/reports/image_quality_report.md
- Output: Image quality assessment script

Then Task 4.2: Visualize Temporal Coverage.
- Plot images by time of day (hourly bins)
- Show coverage gaps
- Identify peak collection times
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/visualize_temporal_coverage.py
- Output: docs/figures/temporal_coverage.png

Then Task 4.3: Visualize Spatial Coverage.
- Map which camera zones have images
- Show coverage density
- Identify spatial gaps
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/visualize_spatial_coverage.py
- Output: docs/figures/spatial_coverage.png

Then Task 4.4: Generate Collection Progress Dashboard.
- Show progress toward 2-week goal (672 images/camera)
- Display images per camera
- Show collection rate trends
- Update existing dashboard or create new: docs/progress_dashboard.html
- Output: Progress dashboard HTML

Finally Task 4.5: Create Baseline Heatmap Visualization Script.
- Script to generate heatmap from stress scores
- Support partial data visualization
- Make it reusable for future updates
- Create script: scripts/2025-11-10/generate_baseline_heatmap.py
- Output: Baseline heatmap generation script (will generate heatmap once features are available)

This work uses image metadata only - no features needed. Can proceed independently.
