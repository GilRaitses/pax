I want to work on BRANCH 2: Empirical Data Structure Definition.

See agentHandoff/worktrees/MULTI_AGENT_WORK_TREE.md for full details.

Let's start with Task 2.1: Research Vision Model Output Formats.
- Review YOLOv8n output format
- Review Detectron2 output format  
- Review CLIP output format
- Document standard formats used in urban vision research
- Create research document: docs/research/vision_model_outputs.md

Then move to Task 2.2: Design Feature Vector Schema.
- Define spatial features (pedestrian count, vehicle count, density)
- Define visual complexity features (scene complexity, lighting, weather)
- Define temporal features (time encoding, day of week)
- Create Pydantic model: src/pax/schemas/feature_vector.py
- Document schema: docs/schemas/feature_vector_spec.md

This work is independent of BRANCH 1 and can proceed in parallel.
